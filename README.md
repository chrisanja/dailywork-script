# Daily Scripts

This repository contains my **daily scripts**.  
It serves as a personal collection of scripts I use or create on a day-to-day basis for learning, automation, and experimentation.

You can clone this repository and use or study the scripts as needed:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/daily-work-scripts.git
```

These scripts are intended for **personal and educational purposes only**.  
Please review any script before running it, especially if it modifies files or interacts with your system.
